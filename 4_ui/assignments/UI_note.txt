Advanced Python Part 4:

PyQt4 VS PySide2
    - pyQt is paid, more feature and more advanced -- Its not use in all DCC need to be added
    - PySide is free, less feature but is very close -- It is use everywhere in all DCC by default

Using only Qt ( from Qt import QtWidgets, QtGui, QtCore) will look at system and use what is available, good for sharing
    - To use QT the application need to include a Qt.py file somewhere in the python path

Z pattern
    - A way of reading Left to right, down left to right etc...
